# Carbon Emission Analysis
![Sample Image](CO2 Footprint.png)

This report aims to analyze carbon emissions to examine the carbon footprint across various industries. We aim to identify sectors with the highest levels of emissions by analyzing them across countries and years, as well as to uncover trends.

Carbon emissions play a crucial role in the environment, accounting for over 75% of global emissions and posing a significant environmental challenge. These emissions contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change, planetary warming, and involvement in various environmental disasters.

Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.

## Data Source
Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

## Data Structure
The dataset consists of 4 tables containing information regarding carbon emissions generated during the production of goods.

**Insights:**
The data reveals that wind turbine production generates high CO2 emissions, with larger models like the G128 5MW (3.7 millions) and G132 5MW (3.2 millions) having the biggest footprint, though their long-term clean energy benefits outweigh initial emissions. Smaller turbines, like the G90 2MW (1.25 millions), produce significantly less. Traditional vehicles, such as the Land Cruiser Prado and Audi A6, contribute around 100,000 ‚Äì 190,000 over their lifecycle, highlighting the environmental impact of fossil-fuel cars. Infrastructure projects, like retaining walls (167,000) and electric motors (160,655), also have substantial emissions, showing the need for greener construction and industrial solutions. The insights emphasize the importance of renewable energy adoption, low-emission transportation, and sustainable materials to reduce environmental impact.üåç

**Insights:**
The top CO2-emitting products fall into four key industry groups: Electrical Equipment and Machinery, Automobiles & Components, Capital Goods, and Materials. Wind turbines produce the highest emissions during production, but they will have long-term clean energy benefits. Automobiles, including the Land Cruiser Prado, Audi A6, and GM vehicles, generate substantial emissions due to fuel consumption and production processes. Industrial equipment like electric motors and construction materials such as retaining wall structures also have significant carbon footprints, mainly from material extraction and heavy industrial processing.üå±

**Insights:**
Spain is the highest contributor to carbon emissions, with a significantly larger footprint (9,786,130) compared to other countries. A deep dive into Spain's emissions sources reveals that Gamesa Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica, S.A. is the primary contributor, with its wind turbine products collectively accounting for the vast majority of Spain‚Äôs emissions (over 9.7 million PCF). This suggests that renewable energy equipment manufacturing, particularly wind turbines, has a substantial carbon footprint in the production phase. Other industries in Spain, such as Energy, Chemicals, Food & Beverage,... contribute relatively minor amounts to total emissions. While the presence of clean energy manufacturing is prominent, its high carbon footprint highlights the embedded emissions in producing large-scale wind energy equipment.

**Insights:**
- The data shows that carbon emissions spiked in 2015, reaching 10.84 million PCF, an increase of 1,636.62% compared to 2014. This peak was followed by a sharp decline in the following years, with emissions falling by 84.87% in 2016 and a further 79.25% in 2017, indicating a major change in manufacturing, policy or reporting.

- As discussed above, Spanish wind turbine manufacturing, specifically from Gamesa Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica, SA, was the main contributor to the increase in emissions in 2015. In addition, the German automotive industry, particularly the production of luxury vehicles by Daimler AG, also contributed to emissions, albeit on a significantly smaller scale than wind turbine manufacturing. This highlights that renewable energy equipment manufacturing and high-end car manufacturing were the main drivers of emissions in 2015, before emissions fell sharply in subsequent years.

**Insights:**
The industries that have shown the most significant decrease in carbon footprints (PCFs) over time include "Technology Hardware & Equipment" (a decline of 165,795 from 2014 to 2016), "Media" (a decrease of 7,837 from 2013 to 2016), "Consumer Durables & Apparel" (a drop of 2,118 from 2014 to 2016), and "Food & Staples Retailing" (a reduction of 771 from 2014 to 2016). This suggests that industries in technology, media, retail, and electronics manufacturing have made significant improvements in optimizing production processes and supply chains to reduce carbon emissions.

## Conclusion
- The data highlights the significant carbon footprint associated with wind turbine production, particularly from large-scale models manufactured by Gamesa Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica, S.A. Despite their high emissions during production, these turbines provide long-term environmental benefits through clean energy generation. The automobile sector, led by companies such as Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG, also contributes substantially to emissions due to vehicle manufacturing and fuel consumption. Additionally, industrial equipment and construction materials, including electric motors and retaining walls, add to the overall carbon footprint, emphasizing the need for sustainable industrial solutions.

- Spain emerges as the largest emitter, mainly due to its wind turbine manufacturing industry, which underscores the high embedded emissions in producing renewable energy equipment. However, a drastic reduction in emissions after 2015 suggests significant shifts in manufacturing practices, policies, or reporting mechanisms. Notably, industries such as Technology Hardware, Media, Consumer Durables & Apparel, and Food & Staples Retailing have successfully reduced their carbon footprints over time, reflecting improvements in production efficiency and supply chain sustainability.

- Overall, the findings emphasize the critical need for a balanced approach‚Äîaccelerating renewable energy adoption while optimizing manufacturing processes to minimize initial carbon emissions. Sustainable transportation, greener industrial solutions, and continued advancements in low-carbon materials are essential to mitigating environmental impact and transitioning towards a more sustainable future.üåç
